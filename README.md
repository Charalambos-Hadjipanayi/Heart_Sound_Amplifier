# Heart Sound Amplifier

In this project we learnt how to use operational amplifiers (op-amps) in circuits, by using a modelling package (SPICE), and by building real circuits. The first part of the project was computer based, the second part was lab-based.

Op-amps can be used in biomedical instrumentation and part of the practical is to look at how op-amps may be used as an amplifier in physiological measurement.

The aim of this project was to design a heart rate amplifier and connect it to a microphone and headphones to create an electronic stethoscope. In the first part of the report, the heart sound amplifier was designed and modelled using PSpice (OrCAD Capture 16.6 2012). In the second part, a stethoscope was implemented in the lab using an electret microphone, the designed amplifier and headphones.
